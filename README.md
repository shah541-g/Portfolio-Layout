## Code Explanation

### Layout & Responsiveness

- The CSS uses a **mobile-first approach**: base styles target mobile devices by default.
- **@media queries** at 900px, 980px, 1100px, and 1340px progressively enhance the layout for tablets and desktops.
- **Flexbox** (via the `.row` and `.flex` classes) aligns items horizontally or vertically, ensuring a flexible and responsive layout.
- Containers use percentage-based widths (`width: 80%`) and auto margins for consistent centering.

### Styling & Theming

- The site uses a **dark theme** with a background color of `#222831`, off-white text (`#EEEEEE`), and a vibrant accent (`rgba(0, 173, 181, 1)`) for highlights and buttons.
- The `.jelly-blue` class is consistently applied for accent text and elements.
- **Buttons** (`.hire-btn`, `.cv-btn`) have pill shapes, shadows, and hover effects for interactivity.

### Component-Based Styling

- CSS classes are organized to match logical components:
  - `.cta`, `.hire-btn`, `.nav-list`, `.about-me__heading`, etc.
- This modular approach makes the code easier to maintain and extend.

### Typography

- **Google Fonts**: 'Poppins' is used for general text, giving a clean, modern appearance, while 'Oswald' is reserved for the developerâ€™s name/logo, lending a distinct character.
- Font sizes, weights, and spacing are defined to create a clear visual hierarchy and improve readability.

## Customization Guide

Follow these steps to tailor the template for your own portfolio:

1. **Change Personal Information**
   - **Name**: Edit the text inside the `<span class="my-name">` tag in `index.html`.
   - **Headline**: Update the `<h1 class="home__heading">` tag for your title or role.
   - **About Me Text**: Modify the `<p class="about-me__paragraph">` with your personal bio.

2. **Update Images**
   - Replace placeholder images in the `./assets/` folder (`home.png`, `about-me.png`, `contact.png`, etc.) with your own images using the same file names, or update the `src` attributes in `index.html` as needed.

3. **Add Your Projects**
   - In the "My recent works" section (`.variants` div), update the `<img>` tags to showcase your own projects and thumbnails.

4. **Modify Color Scheme**
   - All color values are defined at the top of `style.css` or in reusable classes like `.jelly-blue`.
   - Adjust these color codes to match your personal branding preferences.

5. **Update Social Links**
   - In the footer, replace the anchor tagsâ€™ `href` attributes with links to your own social media profiles.
